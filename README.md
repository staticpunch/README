Beyond professional context, I am also a hobbyist who takes great interest in hands-on experimentation: much of my free time is spent reverse-engineering and tweaking models to understand them inside-out. It brings me great sense of fulfillment every time I uncover some underlying mechanism, that is often a result of clever design to solve a problem. Academia contributes cutting-edge research and theoretical foundations, while industry offers real-world problem contexts. I aim to become a researcher that can contribute meaningfully to the field and having tangible impact on human lives.
